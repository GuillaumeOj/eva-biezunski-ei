# Eva Biezunski — Avocate

Marketing website for **Eva Biezunski**, a business-law attorney (avocate au Barreau de Lyon)
specialising in supporting self-employed healthcare professionals (médecins, dentistes,
kinésithérapeutes…).

The site is a single-page presentation covering her practice areas — company formation,
patientèle transfers, professional contracts, legal advice, litigation and compliance — along
with a digital business card (`/carte`) that exposes a downloadable vCard.

## Tech stack

- [Next.js 16](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router) with React 19
- [Tailwind CSS 4](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [lucide-react](https://lucide.dev/) icons
- [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) + Testing Library for tests
- [Bun](https://bun.com/) as the package manager and task runner

## Getting started

Requires [Bun](https://bun.com/) (CI pins `1.3.14`).

```sh
bun install
bun run dev
```

The dev server runs with Turbopack at http://localhost:3000.

## Contact form (Brevo)

The contact form posts to `POST /api/contact`, which sends Eva a transactional email via the
[Brevo](https://www.brevo.com/) API (with the visitor set as `reply-to`). Configure these
environment variables — see [`env.example`](env.example):

| Variable             | Required | Description                                                        |
| -------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `BREVO_API_KEY`      | yes      | Brevo API key (SMTP & API → API Keys).                             |
| `BREVO_SENDER_EMAIL` | yes      | Verified sender email/domain in Brevo (the "from" address).        |
| `BREVO_TO_EMAIL`     | no       | Recipient; defaults to the public contact email in `constants.ts`. |

Set them in `.env.local` for local dev, and in the Vercel project (Production + Preview) for
deployment. The sender must be a **verified sender/domain** in your Brevo account.

[`src/lib/constants.ts`](src/lib/constants.ts) and is fully in French.

## Continuous integration

[`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs on every push to `main` and on pull
requests, executing lint/format, type-check and tests with Bun.
